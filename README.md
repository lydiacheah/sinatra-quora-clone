## Quora Clone
A clone of Quora using a [Ruby Sinatra web skeleton](https://github.com/hollowaykeanho/sinatra-web-server/tree/heroku).

The project was developed to improve my initial understanding of RoR project file structures. The application is currently being hosted on Heroku: http://lydia-quora-clone.herokuapp.com/.
